BZZT...

My sincere apologies.  So sorry to put
you through this.

I've made a mess of things.  You see,
instead of making robots, I made robots
that make robots... and I made them smart...
and now they've all gone hiding.

Shoot the tanks and things.  Oh, there
might be a boss at some point. And get
the powerups! You can't leave without 'em!
