My Sincere Apologies

A game of fun, shooting, and I'm sorry to put you through this


A fabricator robot on Mars was supposed to make a bunch of
robots!  But it got lazy and made robots that could make
other robots.  And it made them smarter than they should have
been.  Now they've all gone off and hidden away in various
tanks and computers.

Happily, he knew how to construct *you*, a simple fighting
robot.  It's your job to clean out each area!

W A S D to strafe
Mouse left-right to rotate
Space to pause
Esc to quit

When you pick up powerups, you can press
1 through 4 to activate or deactivate them:

    1 = triple shot
    2 = damage boost shot
    3 = bouncy shot
    4 = railgun shot

    Note that you can mix and match!  Toggle
    1 and 4 to turn on triple railgun shots!

    Different powerups will have different
    combined effects.  For example, amage
    boost needs more cooldown time, and the
    shots move more slowly too.

    And once you get all four powerups,
    when you turn them all on, you get
    a special weapon just for the end-game
    boss...!
