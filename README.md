My Sincere Apologies
====================

A game of fun, shooting, and I'm sorry to put you through this


A fabricator robot on Mars was supposed to make a bunch of
robots!  But it got lazy and made robots that could make
other robots.  And it made them smarter than they should have
been.  Now they've all gone off and hidden away in various
tanks and computers.

Happily, he knew how to construct *you*, a simple fighting
robot.  It's your job to clean out each area!

Requirements
------------

Check the requirements.txt for all the Python packages
you'll need.

You'll also need AVBin for Pyglet.  You can get that here:
    http://avbin.github.io/AVbin/Download.html


Controls
--------

W A S D moves (strafes)
Move mouse left-right to rotate
Left mouse button to fire
Space to pause
Esc to quit
1 2 3 4 activates and deactivates powerups (see below)


Powerups
--------

When you pick up powerups, you can press
1 through 4 to activate or deactivate them:

    1 = triple shot

    2 = damage boost shot

    3 = bouncy shot

    4 = railgun shot

Note that you can mix and match!  Toggle
1 and 4 to turn on triple railgun shots!

Different powerups will have different
combined effects.  For example, amage
boost needs more cooldown time, and the
shots move more slowly too.

And once you get all four powerups,
when you turn them all on, you get
a special weapon just for the end-game
boss...!


Your HUD
--------

Along the left shows your current active powerups,
with a number to remind you of the correct key.

On the right is your current health.  Above that
are indicators for how many lives you have left.

You start with 5 lives.  Good luck!
