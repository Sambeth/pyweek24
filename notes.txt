NOTES ON DEVELOPMENT


The tileset is in prototype.tmx.  However, json_map needs the
json version, so every time you change prototype, not only must
you save it, you must export it (to JSON) too.

There are currently three layers in the tileset.  From top down:
    * "Player Starting Position" (invisible)
      The player starts at the first non-zero tile found in this layer.
    * Foreground (visible)
      The player collides with tiles found in this layer.
    * Background (visible)
      The player does not collide with tiles found in this layer.

To help you (the player), most collidable objects are purple.
(I also made some collidable blue and green banners.)
The player himself is a grimacing white square.

Collision detection is wonky, but I don't want to fix it just yet
because I bet we're going to change the underlying concepts.  Right
now I assume the player is a 16x16 square, and I bet that will change.
We'll fix it up right once we settle on the player's shape.

Supported keys:
    up down left right = move player
    w a s d = move player (redundant)
    esc = quit
    space = pause

random notes to self

tiled
    margin:
        how many pixels to throw away on the top/left/right/bottom borders
        of the entire image
    spacing:
        how many pixels to throw away between each tile

    e.g. for the Kenney "roguelike_transparent" tile set,
    you want 16x16 tiles, with a spacing of 1
    (don't throw away any pixels along the top/left/right/bottom of
    the image, and throw away 1 pixel between each tile, both x and y)

    roguelike
        actual tileset size is 57 columns x 31 rows
        image is 968 x 526 with margin of 1
            (tilewidth*cols) + (spacing*(cols-1)) = width
            16*57 + 56 = 968
            (tileheight*rows) + (spacing*(rows-1)) = height
    		16*31 + 31 = 526
