tiled
    margin:
        how many pixels to throw away on the top/left/right/bottom borders
        of the entire image
    spacing:
        how many pixels to throw away between each tile

    e.g. for the Kenney "roguelike_transparent" tile set,
    you want 16x16 tiles, with a spacing of 1
    (don't throw away any pixels along the top/left/right/bottom of
    the image, and throw away 1 pixel between each tile, both x and y)

   roguelike actual tileset size is 57 columns x 31 rows
	image is 968 x 526 with margin of 1
		16*57 + 56 = 968
		16*31 + 31 = 526
